#####1.) What do you expect to happen when the greeting variable is referenced in the last line of the code below?
```ruby
if false
  greeting = “hello world”
end

greeting
```

nil - after testing in irb, it appears when referencing local variables in an if statement ruby evaluates to nil and not an exxception

#####2.) What is the result of the last line in the code below?
```ruby
greetings = { a: 'hi' }
informal_greeting = greetings[:a]
informal_greeting << ' there'

puts informal_greeting  #  => "hi there"
puts greetings
```

{:a=>"hi there"} - because ' there' was assigned using `<<` which modified the original hash of greetings

#####3.) In other exercises we have looked at how the scope of variables affects the modification of one "layer" when they are passed to another.

To drive home the salient aspects of variable scope and modification of one scope by another, consider the following similar sets of code.

What will be printed by each of these code groups?

A)

```ruby
def mess_with_vars(one, two, three)
  one = two
  two = three
  three = one
end

one = "one"
two = "two"
three = "three"

mess_with_vars(one, two, three)

puts "one is: #{one}"
puts "two is: #{two}"
puts "three is: #{three}"
```

```ruby
"one is one"
"two is two"
"three is three"
```

B)

```ruby
def mess_with_vars(one, two, three)
  one = "two"
  two = "three"
  three = "one"
end

one = "one"
two = "two"
three = "three"

mess_with_vars(one, two, three)

puts "one is: #{one}"
puts "two is: #{two}"
puts "three is: #{three}"
```

```ruby
"one is one"
"two is two"
"three is three"
```

C)

```ruby
def mess_with_vars(one, two, three)
  one.gsub!("one","two")
  two.gsub!("two","three")
  three.gsub!("three","one")
end

one = "one"
two = "two"
three = "three"

mess_with_vars(one, two, three)

puts "one is: #{one}"
puts "two is: #{two}"
puts "three is: #{three}"
```

```ruby
"one is two"
"two is three"
"three is one"
```

#####4.) A UUID is a type of identifier often used as a way to uniquely identify items...which may not all be created by the same system. That is, without any form of synchronization, two or more separate computer systems can create new items and label them with a UUID with no significant chance of stepping on each other's toes.

It accomplishes this feat through massive randomization. The number of possible UUID values is approximately 3.4 X 10E38.

Each UUID consists of 32 hexadecimal characters, and is typically broken into 5 sections like this 8-4-4-4-12 and represented as a string.

It looks like this: "f65c57f6-a6aa-17a8-faa1-a67f2dc9fa91"

Write a method that returns one UUID when called with no parameters.

```ruby
def create_UUID
  blocks = [8, 4, 4, 4, 12]
  valid_chars = ['a','b','c','d','e','f','0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9'] 

  uuid = ""
  blocks.each_with_index do |block, index|
    block.times { uuid += valid_chars.sample }
    uuid += '-' unless index >= (blocks.size - 1)
  end

  uuid
end
```

#####5.) Ben was tasked to write a simple ruby method to determine if an input string is an IP address representing dot-separated numbers. e.g. "10.4.5.11". He is not familiar with regular expressions. Alyssa supplied Ben with a method called is_a_number? to determine if a string is a number and asked Ben to use it.
```ruby
def dot_separated_ip_address?(input_string)
  dot_separated_words = input_string.split(".")
  while dot_separated_words.size > 0 do
    word = dot_separated_words.pop
    break if !is_a_number?(word)
  end
  return true
end
```

Alyssa reviewed Ben's code and says "It's a good start, but you missed a few things. You're not returning a false condition, and not handling the case that there are more or fewer than 4 components to the IP address (e.g. "4.5.5" or "1.2.3.4.5" should be invalid)."

Help Ben fix his code.

```ruby
def dot_separated_ip_address?(input_string)
  dot_separated_words = input_string.split(".")
  return false unless dot_separated_words.size == 4
  
  while dot_separated_words.size > 0 do
    word = dot_separated_words.pop
    return false unless is_a_number?(word)
  end
  
  true
end
```
